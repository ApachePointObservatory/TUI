<h2><a href="../../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="../index.html">Instruments</a>:<a href="index.html">GIFS</a>:GIFS window</h2>

<p>Displays the current status of the Goddard Integral Field Spectrograph (GIFS) and allows you to change the configuration.

<p>Pushing the "Config" button displays configuration controls (each to the right of its corresponding item of status). Select TUI:Save Window Positions to remember the state of this checkbutton.
<ul>
	<li>Controls with a colored background will be changed when you hit Apply.
	<li>The contextual menu on each control can return that control to the current setting of the instrument.
</ul>

<p><a name="Presets"></a><b>Presets</b> allows you to set any of a large number of standard configurations, and save your own. This is only visible if Config is checked.

<ul>
	<li>Use Presets:Edit:Save to save the state of the configuration controls as a named preset. Note that it saves the state of the controls, not the actual state of the instrument, so you can save any preset you like without commanding the instrument.
	<li>The Presets:Edit menu also allows to rename and delete saved presets.
	<li>Select a named preset to set the configuration controls to that preset. Then change any controls you like and press Apply to apply.
	<li>Presets are saved in a file whose location is given in TUI:About TUI.
</ul>

<p>Below the items is a status bar that shows help and the state of the currently executing configuration command.

<p><a name="CmdButtons"></a>The buttons along the bottom are as follows:

<ul>
	<li><b>Expose...</b>: opens the separate GIFS <a href="../ExposeWin.html">Expose window</a>.
	<li><b>Config</b>: show or hide the configuration controls.
	<p>The following are only available if the configuration controls are showing:
	<li><b>Apply</b>: apply the requested changes by sending a series of commands to GIFS.
	<li><b>X</b>: cancel your pending configuration changes. The current command is allowed to finish, but any subsequent commands are flushed.
	<li><b>Current</b>: reset all configuration widgets to the current state of the instrument.
</ul>
